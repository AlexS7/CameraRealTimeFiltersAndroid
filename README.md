#Pointop - An android realtime processing app.

The purpose of this app development is purely for fun and educational reasons.
 
My main goal is to learn Android Development and Computer Vision.
This app uses [Renderscript](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/renderscript/compute.html).

Please do have a look (fork it) and contribute in anyway you can (check issues list)! 
The code from **develop branch** is the only one that runs for now, so do not try to run any other branches.

*This is in very early stages and many things will not work yet!*
